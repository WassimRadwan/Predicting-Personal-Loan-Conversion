# The Case:
We are presented with a sample of 4499 customers of a large Canadian bank that currently has a surplus of liability customers, i.e., depositors. The bank would like to grow their asset customer base, i.e., borrowers, through a targeted marketing campaign. Previous marketing efforts were able to garner a roughly 10% conversion rate, where a conversion was considered to be a sale of a personal loan product to an existing liability customer. From this campaign, which was held in Toronto, a data set was established and to be used to improve the efficiency of this yearâ€™s marketing campaign. This efficiency boost will stem from designing an algorithm to predict which clients are most likely to convert on the personal loan, and then focus marketing on this group. All sampled customers have a financial advisor/planner with this bank. The financial planners are mobile and can come to the customers if they wish so, however, listed in the data set are the branches that they most often serve. Financial advisors earn commission if they can advise customers to buy a personal loan product.
